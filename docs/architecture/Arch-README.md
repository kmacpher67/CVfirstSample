This document is meant to be a concrete guide to implementation, standards, and educational reuse. The sections are break out details about the main component itemes with a master reference at the bottom annotated with key URLs or refernce materials useful to understanding or implementing the overall or specific areas. 

## Overall Architecture, distributed ephemeral connections
The overall architecture is guided by the CSI-Clue challange, this section may become a bit recursive, in that some elements of the design will find their origin here and others genisis are from the CSI-Clue documents (somewhat of chicken & egg paradigm.) The objective of this section is capture and extend both the strategy and tactics of the system architecture. The attempt is to create a common platform approach for future iterations. 

The system is built upon a component based approach.  Using a communication layer like Bluetooth, each component will have the ability to communicate with the other. 

## Data generation, propagation, and archival


##  Controls

## Logic, AI, & Decision making
